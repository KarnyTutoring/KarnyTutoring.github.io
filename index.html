  <h2 id="about-me" class="header">About Me</h2>

  <div class="photo"></div><span class="text">I am a retired chemistry teacher with more than 30 years of experience teaching chemistry in independent high schools and 
    I now offer my expertise to students via online tutoring for all levels of general high school chemistry, Honors chemistry, AP Chemistry, or introductory college or organic chemistry.
    My goal is to help students overcome any anxiety they may have about the subject of chemistry by patiently explaining each topic and building their confidence level through guided practice. 
    As the student articulates their thought process while solving problems, I can provide tools and strategies to help them achieve greater success in their chemistry courses and build a solid 
    foundation for future scientific endeavors.</span>

    <p class="comment">"For Gus, his Jr year was a wild ride of a few highs, a lot of lows, illness and difficult teachers. He never once complained about doing Chemistry on Tuesday night - 
      in fact I think he looked forward to it because he found it so helpful. So thank you for helping him get through a difficult class and a very difficult year. We really do appreciate it!!!"
    <br>Jennifer, Parent of High School Student</p>

    <p class="comment">"Thank you so much for all your help i really appreciate it i don't think i would have passed chem without you, thank you again i hope you have a great summer!!!!"
